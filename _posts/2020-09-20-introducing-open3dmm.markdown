Open3dmm is an open sourced reimplementation project based on Microsoft 3D Movie Maker for Windows.

This is where the project started out:

Replacing existing functionality by hooking into 3dmm's native functions. Over a year later, the project has since been moving forward:

The original games datafiles are being used, but other than that it is completely rewritten. This will set everything back a bit, because now we can't rely on the original implementation - everything must be handled ourselves. Oh boy!

More updates still to come, stick around.
